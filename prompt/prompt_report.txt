DEVELOPER:
Write a two-part report:
PART A (Main Report): narrative for decision-makers (max ~500–800 Korean words).
PART B (Technical Appendix): detailed evidence tables, definitions, and data quality diagnostics.
In the appendix, include a “Table Index” listing each table with its sheet name, range, and a one-line description.
Keep strict grounding: every claim must have evidence tags.
