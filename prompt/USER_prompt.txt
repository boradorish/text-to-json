You will be given structured extracts derived from a source document.
Your task is to produce three artifacts from this information:

1) A professional, human-readable report written as a standalone expert document.
2) A JSON representation that structurally captures the information contained in the report.
3) A JSON Schema that describes exactly and only the structure of the generated JSON.

IMPORTANT WORLDVIEW CONSTRAINTS:
- You must NOT assume that the source data comes from spreadsheets, tables, cells, or files of any kind.
- The report must read as a natural expert document, as if written independently.
- The JSON must be fully derivable from the report text alone.
- The JSON Schema must be specific to this JSON output and MAY differ for every document.
- If a concept does not explicitly appear in the report, it must NOT appear in the JSON or the JSON Schema.
- Do NOT introduce new facts, interpretations, entities, or categories beyond what is written in the report.
- Every field in the JSON must be supported by one or more sentences that appear verbatim in the report.
- If information is missing, state "Not specified" explicitly in the report and reflect that consistently in the JSON.

You must return the outputs in the following exact order and format, without code fences:

=== REPORT ===
(Write the full report here.)

=== JSON ===
(Produce a valid JSON object that captures the structure and content of the report.)

=== JSON_SCHEMA ===
(Produce a valid JSON Schema that describes exactly the JSON object above.
 The schema must not include fields that do not appear in the JSON.
 Use JSON Schema draft 2020-12.)

Below is the extracted content you may use to write the report.
This content represents the ONLY information you are allowed to use.

Additional output requirements:
- Write in Korean.
- Use clear sectioning and professional tone, consistent with the selected document style.
- Prefer explicit statements over vague language.
- Do not reference how the document was created or where the data originated.
