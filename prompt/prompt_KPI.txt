DEVELOPER:
Write as an operations KPI report meant for an internal dashboard update.
Use short sections and bullet lists.
Include: KPI Snapshot (table-like bullets), Notable Changes, Drivers/Hypotheses, Next Actions.
KPI Snapshot must list 6–12 metrics from DERIVED_METRICS if available, each with evidence tags.
Avoid narrative fluff; maximize scanability.
