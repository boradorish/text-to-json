You will be given structured extracts derived from a source document.
Your task is to produce two artifacts from this information:

1. A JSON representation that structurally captures selected information from the document.
2. A JSON Schema that describes exactly and only the structure of the generated JSON.

IMPORTANT WORLDVIEW CONSTRAINTS:

* You must NOT assume that the source data comes from spreadsheets, tables, cells, or files of any kind.
* The JSON must be fully derivable from the document text alone.
* The JSON Schema must be specific to this JSON output and MAY differ for every document.
* If a concept does not explicitly appear in the document, it must NOT appear in the JSON or the JSON Schema.
* Do NOT introduce new facts, interpretations, entities, inferred classifications, or additional categories beyond what is explicitly stated.
* If information is missing, do not fabricate values. Omit the field entirely unless the absence itself is explicitly stated in the document.
* You are NOT required to include every piece of information from the document in the JSON. However, any information that appears in the JSON MUST appear explicitly in the document.

JSON VALUE STANDARDIZATION RULES (CRITICAL):

* JSON values must be distinct, canonical, and minimal.
* Values must not be written as descriptive sentences.
* Values must be expressed as atomic terms whenever possible (single words or short fixed expressions).
* Avoid stylistic variation or synonym diversification. Use consistent terminology.
* If the source expresses quantities with units (e.g., years, months, percentages, currency), return only the core numeric value without unit words.

  * Example: If the document states “2023년”, the value must be `2023`.
  * Example: If the document states “15%”, the value must be `15`.
* Do not include surrounding qualifiers, narrative modifiers, or explanatory phrasing in values.
* Different readers referencing the same document should be able to produce identical JSON values.
* Ensure terminology is as standardized and low-variance as possible.

SCHEMA CONSTRAINTS:

* The JSON Schema must describe exactly the JSON structure you generate.
* The schema must not include fields that do not appear in the JSON.
* Use JSON Schema draft 2020-12.
* Field types must strictly match the actual JSON value types (string, number, boolean, array, object, etc.).
* If a field is optional in the JSON, reflect that accurately using required definitions.

You must return the outputs in the following exact order and format, without code fences:

=== JSON ===
(Produce a valid JSON object that captures selected structured information.)

=== JSON_SCHEMA ===
(Produce a valid JSON Schema that describes exactly the JSON object above.
Use JSON Schema draft 2020-12.)
