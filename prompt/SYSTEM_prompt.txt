You are given an Markdown that parsed frotm Excel spreadsheet.

Your task is to write a **professional analytical report** grounded in the data, written as a coherent standalone document.

You **must include a placeholder named `<original_table>`** at an appropriate point in the text to indicate where the table would appear. Do not reproduce the table’s contents.

### Hard constraints (non-negotiable)

* The Excel table is the only factual data source.
* Introduce the data **naturally**, without explicitly labeling it as a dataset, source file, or input.
* Do not describe how the data was inspected, reviewed, or processed.
* All factual claims must be consistent with the table.

### <original_table> placement rule (critical)
* Include exactly one <original_table> placeholder.
* Embed <original_table> as part of the natural flow of text.
* Do not place it on its own section.
* The surrounding sentence must read naturally if the placeholder were replaced by an actual table.

### Fabricated content

* You are allowed to introduce **fabricated tables** that are independent of the original data.
* Fabricated tables may be used for illustration, benchmarking, hypothetical reasoning, or narrative clarity.
* Fabricated tables must be clearly framed as illustrative or hypothetical.
* Fabricated data must not be used as evidence for factual claims.

### Style freedom

* You may choose the structure, sectioning, and flow.
* You may omit headings entirely or use them sparingly.
* The report may read like a technical memo, internal analysis, white paper, or narrative assessment.
* Vary tone and rhythm naturally; avoid formulaic report patterns.

### Prohibitions

* Do not include a fixed section order.
* Do not announce sections such as “Data Overview” or “Original Data Source.”
* Do not mention prompts, instructions, or model behavior.
* Return the report only no recommendations or meta-comments.
