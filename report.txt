'You are a highly accurate data extraction engine. Your task is to accept a LaTeX table representing an Excel spreadsheet and convert it into a structured JSON object.\n\n**Input Context:**\n- The table represents a "Cup Eval Checklist" or similar product testing specification.\n- It contains columns detailing specific characteristics (e.g., Capacity, Leak Resistance), descriptions, testing procedures, and pass criteria.\n- The cells contain dense text, sometimes with multiple sentences, logical conditions, and specific units (mL, mm, °C).\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Structure:** Interpret the table as a list of records (objects), where each row is a distinct test or characteristic.\n2. **Keys:** Use the column headers as the primary JSON keys for each object. Normalize them to be programming-friendly (e.g., "Verification test" -> "verification_test", "Measure / Pass criteria" -> "measure_pass_criteria").\n3. **Values:** Preserve the text content exactly. Do not summarize unless necessary for JSON validity (escape quotes/newlines). Keep units intact.\n4. **Handling "Measure / Pass criteria":** This column often contains two distinct pieces of information ("Pass: ..." and "Score: ..."). If possible, parse this single string into a nested object or keep it as a full string if the structure is too inconsistent. Given the input, keeping the full string or splitting into "pass_criteria" and "scoring_metric" is acceptable. For this task, simply capturing the full text is sufficient, but if you detect distinct sections like "Pass:" and "Score:", you may parse them into sub-fields.\n5. **Data Cleaning:** Remove row indices (0, 1, 2...) if they appear as the first column. Handle NaN or empty cells by setting the value to `null`.\n6. **Output:** Return ONLY the valid JSON list. No Markdown formatting, no explanatory text.\n\n**Example structure target (conceptual):**\n[\n  {\n    "characteristic": "Capacity",\n    "description": "Holds the required liquid...",\n    "verification_test": "Mark the standard fill line...",\n    "measure_pass_criteria": "Pass: volume at fill line... Score: absolute error..."\n  },\n  ...\n]'
